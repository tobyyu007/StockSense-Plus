What is the summary of this financial text', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': \"on june 17 , 2011 , in response to a request from the alliance for telecommunications industry solutions , or atis , the north american organizational partner for 3gpp , we also agreed to make available a non-exclusive patent license to 3gpp members desiring to implement the technical specifications identified by us , as set forth in the updated licensing declaration under atis ' ipr policy . we believe that we are positioned to license our essential security patents to 3gpp members as they move into 4g . we intend to license our patent portfolio , technology and software , including our secure domain name registry service , to domain infrastructure providers , communication service providers as well as to system integrators . we believe that the market opportunity for our software and technology solutions is large and expanding as secure domain names are now an integral part of securing the next generation 4g/lte wireless networks . we also believe that all 4g mobile devices will require unique secure domain names and become part of a secure domain name registry . our software and technology solutions provide the security platform required by next-generation internet-based applications such as instant messaging , or im , voice over internet protocol , or voip , mobile services , streaming video , file transfer and remote desktop . our technology generates secure connections on a “ zero-click ” or “ single-click ” basis , significantly simplifying the deployment of secure real-time communication solutions by eliminating the need for end-users to enter any encryption information . in connection with the settlement of our lawsuit against microsoft corporation in 2010 , microsoft became our first licensee . pursuant to the settlement and license agreement between us and microsoft , microsoft paid us $ 200 million , which has been recognized as gain on settlement and microsoft was granted a worldwide , irrevocable , nonexclusive , non-sublicenseable fully paid up license for our patents for microsoft products . we intend to seek further license of our technology , including our gabriel connection technology to enterprise customers , developers and original equipment manufacturers , or oems , of chips , servers , smart phones , tablets , e-readers , laptops , net books and other devices , within the ip-telephony , mobility , fixed-mobile convergence and unified communications markets including 4g/lte . our employees include the core development team behind our patent portfolio , technology and software . this team has worked together for over ten years and is the same team that invented and developed this technology while working at science application international corporation , or saic . saic is a fortune 500® scientific , engineering and technology applications company that uses its deep domain knowledge to solve problems of vital importance to the nation and the world , in national security , energy and the environment , critical infrastructure and health . the team has continued its research and development work started at saic and expanded the set of patents we acquired in 2006 from saic into a larger portfolio with 46 issued u.s. and foreign patents and numerous pending u.s. and foreign patent applications . this portfolio now serves as the foundation of our licensing business and planned service offerings and is expected to generate the majority of our future revenue in license fees and royalties . we intend to continue our research and development efforts to further strengthen and expand our patent portfolio . please see item 7 – management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – operations – research and development expenses for a description of our research and development expenses for the past three fiscal years . we intend to continue using an outsourced and leveraged model to maintain efficiency and manage costs as we grow our licensing business by offering incentives to early licensing targets or asserting our rights for use of our patents . we also intend to expand our design pilot in participation with leading 4g/lte companies ( domain infrastructure providers , chipset manufacturers , service providers , and others ) and build our secure domain name registry . 21 index developments in the year ended december 31 , 2011 litigation on january 12 , 2011 , we initiated a lawsuit by filing a complaint against siemens and mitel in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas , tyler division , pursuant to which we allege that these companies infringe two of our patents . on february 4 , 2011 , we amended our original complaint , filed on august 11 , 2010 , against aastra , apple , cisco and nec in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas , tyler division , to assert u.s. patent no . 7,418,504 against apple and aastra . on april 5 , 2011 , we again amended our complaint against aastra , apple , cisco and nec in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas , tyler division , to include apple 's ipad 2 in the list of apple products that are accused of infringing our patents . we also asserted our newly-issued patent , u.s. patent no . 7,921,211 against all of the defendants in that lawsuit . also on april 5 , 2011 , we amended our original complaint , filed on january 12 , 2011 , against siemens and mitel in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas , tyler division , to assert our newly-issued patent , u.s. patent no . 7,921,211 against all of the defendants in that lawsuit . story_separator_special_tag in addition , we record stock and options granted to non-employees at fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity investments issued as they vest over the performance period . fair value of financial instruments fair value is the price that would result from an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date . a fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value . the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities ( level 1 measurement ) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs ( level 3 measurement ) . level 2 measurements utilize observable inputs in markets other than active markets . our financial instruments are stated at amounts that equal , or are intended to approximate , fair value . when we approximate fair value , we utilize market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument , including assumptions about risk and inputs to the valuation technique . we use quoted valuation techniques , primarily the income and market approach that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs for recurring fair value measurements . 24 index new accounting pronouncements in may 2011 , the fasb issued a new accounting standard update , which amends the fair value measurement guidance and includes some enhanced disclosure requirements . the most significant change in disclosures is an expansion of the information required for level 3 measurements based on unobservable inputs . the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 , 2011. the adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures . in june 2011 , the fasb issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard which requires companies to present net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate , but consecutive , statements . in addition , in december 2011 , the fasb issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard which defers the requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement . we will adopt this standard in the first quarter of 2012. in september 2011 , the fasb issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard , which provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing on goodwill is necessary . specifically , an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step test . if an entity believes , as a result of its qualitative assessment , that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount , the quantitative impairment test is required . otherwise , no further testing is required . this standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 , 2011. the adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements . 25 index operations revenue - royalties revenue generated for the twelve months ended december 31 , 2011 was approximately $ 20 compared to $ 68 for the twelve months ended december 31 , 2010 and $ 26 for the twelve months ended december 31 , 2009. our revenue in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , was solely limited to the royalties earned under our single license agreement through our japanese subsidiary . we expect the revenue from this license will continue to be insignificant in the future . we do not intend to seek additional licenses or other revenue through our japanese subsidiary . gain on settlement in june 2010 , we received $ 200,000 from microsoft corporation related to a licensing agreement and originally classified it as revenue . upon further analysis , we determined that we could not practically and objectively separate any settlement portion from the revenue element as discussed under the guidance of u.s. gaap accounting standards codification topic 605 : revenue recognition , or asc topic 605. as a result , we reclassified this amount in our 2010 financial statements to present it as a gain on settlement . this reclassification had no impact on our net income , financial position or cash flows for any period . we did not receive a gain on settlement for the twelve months ended december 31 , 2011 or 2009 , respectively . royalty expense there was no royalty expense for the year ended december 31 , 2011 , compared to $ 59,207 for the year ended december 31 , 2010 , and zero for the year ended december 31 , 2009. under our agreements with saic , we were obligated to pay saic 35 % of the proceeds from the settlement of litigation with microsoft after reduction for costs , including legal fees and expenses , incurred by us and saic in connection with the microsoft litigation . research and development expenses research and development costs include expenses paid to outside development consultants and compensation-related expenses for our engineering staff . research and development costs are expensed as incurred . our research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 , 2011 was $ 1,464 compared to $ 2,412 for the year ended december 31 , 2010 and $ 864 for the year ended december 31 , 2009. the decrease in 2011 was primarily due to the decrease in bonuses paid in 2011 compared to 2010. the increase in 2010 as compared to 2009 , was primarily due to the increase in wages and medical costs and bonuses paid to our research and development staff . selling , general and administrative expenses selling , general and administrative expenses include compensation expense for management and administrative personnel , as well as expenses for outside legal , accounting , and consulting services . our selling\\n\", 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december 31 , 2011 , our cash and cash equivalents totaled $ 49,482 and our short-term investments totaled $ 14,438 compared to $ 34,635 and $ 43,457 , respectively , for the year ended december 31 , 2010 and $ 2,011 and zero , respectively , as of december 31 , 2009. we recognized an unrealized loss on our investments of $ 4 for the year ended december 31 , 2011 compared to $ 984 for the year ended december 31 , 2010 and no gain or loss for the twelve months ended december 31 , 2009 , as we did not have any investments available for sale as of december 31 , 2009. we have determined that this loss in 2011 and 2010 is temporary because the fair value of our investment securities is below the carrying value due to the changes in interest rates and we anticipate that this loss will be reversed over the securities remaining lives . 26 index before entering into the microsoft settlement , we allocated a large amount of cash to legal fees and other expenses associated with the microsoft litigation . we expect that our cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 , 2011 , will be sufficient to fund our operations and provide working capital for general corporate purposes and legal expenses includingthe expenses for our ongoing complaints against aastra , apple , cisco , nec , siemens , mitel and avaya in the united states district court of the eastern district of texas , tyler division , as well as the complaint with the u.s. international

What is the summary of this financial text\n\nHuman: on december 26 , 2013 , the frb approved the company 's request to pay outstanding cumulative dividends on its series a preferred stock . these deferred dividends were paid by the company on february 18 , 2014 . 15 index a summary of our results of operations and financial condition and select metrics is included in the following table : replace_table_token_3_th as a bank holding company , management focuses on key ratios in evaluating the company 's financial condition and results of operations . in the current economic environment , key ratios regarding asset credit quality and efficiency are more informative as to the financial condition of the company than those utilized in a more normal economic period such as return on equity and return on assets . asset quality for all banks and bank holding companies , asset quality plays a significant role in the overall financial condition of the institution and results of operations . the company measures asset quality in terms of nonaccrual loans as a percentage of gross loans , and net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans . net charge-offs are calculated as the difference between charged-off loans and recovery payments received on previously charged-off loans . the following table summarizes asset quality metrics : replace_table_token_4_th asset and deposit growth the ability to originate new loans and attract new deposits is fundamental to the company 's asset growth . the company 's assets and liabilities are comprised primarily of loans and deposits . total assets increased to $ 539.0 million at december 31 , 2013 from $ 532.1 million at december 31 , 2012. total loans including net deferred fees and unearned income increased by $ 12.8 million , or 2.9 % , to $ 462.0 million as of december 31 , 2013 compared to december 31 , 2012. total deposits increased slightly to $ 436.1 million as of december 31 , 2013 from $ 434.2 million as of december 31 , 2012 . 16 index results of operatons the following table sets forth a summary financial overview for the comparable years : replace_table_token_5_th 17 index interest rates and differentials the following table illustrates average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated : replace_table_token_6_th ( 1 ) includes nonaccrual loans .

and adjustable rate loans written for a terms of 25 to 30 years with the initial interest rates fixed for the first 5 or 10 years and then adjusting annually subject to caps and floors . heloc the bank provides lines of credit collateralized by residential real estate , home equity lines of credit ( “ heloc ” ) , for consumer related purposes . typically , helocs are collateralized by a second deed of trust . the combined loan-to-value , first trust deed and second trust deed , are not to exceed 75 % on all new helocs . other installment loans installment loans consist of automobile and general-purpose loans made to individuals . 26 index the following table sets forth the amount of loans outstanding by type of loan as of december 31 , 2013 that were contractually due in one year or less , more than one year and less than five years , and more than five years based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal . lines of credit or other loans having no stated final maturity and no stated schedule of repayments are reported as due in one year or less . the tables also present an analysis of the rate structure for loans within the same maturity time periods . actual cash flows from these loans may differ materially from contractual maturities due to prepayment , refinancing or other factors . replace_table_token_14_th at december 31 , 2013 , total loans consisted of 77.8 % with floating rates and 22.2 % with fixed rates . the following table presents total gross loans based on remaining scheduled contractual repayments of principal as of the periods indicated : replace_table_token_15_th concentrations of lending activities the company 's lending activities are primarily driven by the customers served in the market areas where the company has branch offices in the central coast of california . the company monitors concentrations within five broad categories : geography , industry , product , call code , and collateral . the company grants manufactured housing , commercial , sba , construction , real estate and consumer loans to customers through branch offices located in the company 's primary markets . the company 's business is concentrated in these areas and the loan portfolio includes significant credit exposure to the manufactured housing and commercial real estate markets of these areas . as of december 31 , 2013 and 2012 , manufactured housing comprised 36.3 % and 38.3 % , respectively of total loans . the company performs a monthly analysis of the manufactured housing loan portfolio which includes weighted average and stratification of various components of credit quality , including loan-to-value , borrower fico score , loan maturity , debt-to-income ratio , loan amount , mobile home age , mobile home park and location . this concentration is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the portfolio consists of 1,786 individual borrowers as of december 31 , 2013 in over 50 mobile home parks . the bank analyzes these concentrations on a quarterly basis and reports the risk related to concentrations to the board of directors . management believes the systems in place coupled with the diversity of the portfolios are adequate to mitigate concentration risk . as of december 31 , 2013 and 2012 , commercial real estate loans accounted for approximately 30.1 % and 27.3 % of total loans , respectively . approximately 62.2 % and 59.1 % of these commercial real estate loans were owner-occupied at december 31 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively . substantially all of these loans are secured by first liens with an average loan to value ratios of 48.5 % and 47.8 % at december 31 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively . the company was within established policy limits at december 31 , 2013 and 2012 . 27 index interest reserves interest reserves are generally established at the time of the loan origination as an expense item in the budget for a construction and land development loan . the company 's practice is to monitor the construction , sales and or leasing progress to determine the feasibility of ongoing construction and development projects . if , at any time during the life of the loan , the project is determined not to be viable , the company discontinues the use of the interest reserve and may take appropriate action to protect its collateral position via renegotiation and or legal action as deemed appropriate . at december 31 , 2013 , the company had five loans with an outstanding balance of $ 5.7 million with available interest reserves of $ 0.1 million . impaired loans a loan is considered impaired when , based on current information ; it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and or interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement . factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status , collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and or interest payments . loans that experience insignificant payment delays or payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired . management determines the significance of payment delays or payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis . when determining the possibility of impairment , management considers the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower , including the length of the delay , the reasons for the delay , the borrower 's prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed . for collateral-dependent loans , the company uses the fair value of collateral method to measure impairment . all other loans are measured for impairment based on the present value of future cash flows . impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for all loans in the portfolio . a\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nAssistant: liquidity liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals , fund asset growth and business operations , and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates . liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in our business operations or unanticipated events . the ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors , creditors and regulators . our liquidity , represented by cash and amounts due from banks , federal funds sold and non-pledged marketable securities , is a result of our operating , investing and financing activities and related cash flows . in order to ensure funds are available when necessary , on at least a quarterly basis , we project the amount of funds that will be required , and we strive to maintain relationships with a diversified customer base . liquidity requirements can also be met through short-term borrowings or the disposition of short-term assets . the company has federal funds borrowing lines at correspondent banks totaling $ 10 million . in addition , loans and securities are pledged to the fhlb providing $ 61.4 million in available borrowing capacity as of december 31 , 2013. loans and securities pledged to the frb discount window provided $ 123.9 million in borrowing capacity . as of december 31 , 2013 , there were no outstanding borrowings from the frb . 37 index the company has established policies as well as analytical tools to manage liquidity . proper liquidity management ensures that sufficient funds are available to meet normal operating demands in addition to unexpected customer demand for funds , such as high levels of deposit withdrawals or increased loan demand , in a timely and cost effective manner . the most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of core deposits . ultimately , public confidence is gained through profitable operations , sound credit quality and a strong capital position .\n<|end_of_text|>\nYou are a seasoned stock market analyst. What is the summary of this financial text\n\nHuman: we have one reportable segment with businesses that include our core news product and other interest-specific products , and related content and services . we generate revenues principally from subscriptions and advertising . other revenues primarily consist of revenues from licensing , wirecutter affiliate referrals , the leasing of floors in the company headquarters , commercial printing , television and film , retail commerce and our live events business . our main operating costs are employee-related costs . in the accompanying analysis of financial information , we present certain information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america ( “ gaap ” ) . we are presenting in this report supplemental non-gaap financial performance measures that exclude depreciation , amortization , severance , non-operating retirement costs and certain identified special items , as applicable . these non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related gaap measures and should be read in conjunction with financial information presented on a gaap basis . for further information and reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures , see “ — results of operations — non-gaap financial measures . ” the new york times company – p. 29 the company changed the expense captions on its consolidated statement of operations effective for the quarter ended march 29 , 2020. these changes were made in order to reflect how the company manages its business and to communicate where the company is investing resources and how this aligns with the company 's strategy . the company reclassified expenses for the prior periods in order to present comparable financial results . there was no change to consolidated operating income , total operating costs , net income or cash flows as a result of this change in classification . see note 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more detail . we believe that a number of factors and industry trends have , and will continue to , present risks and challenges to our business . for a detailed discussion of certain factors that could affect our business , results of operations and financial condition , see “ item 1a — risk factors . ” 2020 financial highlights in 2020 , diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $ 0.60 , compared with $ 0.83 for 2019. diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding severance , non-operating retirement costs and special items discussed below ( or “ adjusted diluted earnings per share , ” a non-gaap measure ) were $ 0.97 for 2020 , compared with $ 0.92 for 2019. operating profit in 2020 was $ 176.3 million , compared with $ 175.6 million for 2019 , as the decrease in operating costs was largely offset by lower revenues . operating profit before depreciation , amortization , severance , multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs and special items discussed below ( or “ adjusted operating profit , ” a non-gaap measure ) was $ 250.6 million and $ 248.4 million for 2020 and 2019 , respectively . total revenues decreased 1.6 % to $ 1.78 billion in 2020 from $ 1.81 billion in 2019 , primarily driven by a decrease in advertising revenue and other revenue , partially offset by an increase in digital-only subscription revenues . subscription revenues increased 10.3 % to $ 1.20 billion in 2020. advertising revenues decreased 26.1 % to $ 392.4 million in 2020 largely due to lower print advertising revenue , driven by reduced spending by advertisers in connection with the effects of the covid-19 pandemic , which further accelerated secular trends . other revenues decreased 0.9 % to $ 195.9 million in 2020. operating costs decreased in 2020 to $ 1.61 billion from $ 1.63 billion in 2019 , due to a decrease in sales and marketing costs and cost of revenue costs , partially offset by an increase in product development costs and general and administrative costs . operating costs before depreciation , amortization , severance and multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs ( or “ adjusted operating costs , ” a non-gaap measure ) decreased in 2020 to $ 1.53 billion from $ 1.56 billion in 2019. impact of covid-19 pandemic the global covid-19 pandemic , and efforts to contain it , have continued to cause significant economic disruption , market volatility and uncertainty . these conditions have affected our business and could continue to do so for the foreseeable future . unlike many media companies , which are primarily dependent on advertising , we derive substantial revenue from subscriptions ( approximately 67 % of total revenues in 2020 ) . we experienced significant growth in the number of subscriptions to our digital news and other products in 2020 , which we believe was attributable in part to an increase in traffic given the news environment , and we do not expect the 2020 growth rate to be sustainable or indicative of results for future periods . while subscriptions grew , revenues from the single-copy and bulk sales of our print newspaper ( which collectively represented approximately 6 % of our total subscription revenues in 2020 ) were , and we expect will continue to be , adversely affected as a result of widespread business closures , continued increased levels of remote working and reductions in travel . the worldwide economic conditions caused by the pandemic also led to a significant decline in our advertising revenues in 2020 , and we expect that our advertising revenues will likely continue to be adversely affected if and while these conditions persist . however , our strong balance sheet has enabled us to continue to operate without the liquidity issues experienced by many other companies . as of december 27 , 2020 , we had cash , cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities of $ 882.0 story_separator_special_tag paid digital-only subscriptions totaled approximately 4,395,000 at the end of 2019 , a net increase of 1,035,000 subscriptions compared with the end of 2018. the growth in our digital subscriptions is attributable in part to an increase in traffic given the news environment , as well as a change made to the digital access model during 2019 , which requires users to register and log in to access most of our content . digital-only news product subscriptions totaled approximately 3,429,000 at the end of 2019 , a net increase of 716,000 subscriptions compared with the end of 2018. other product subscriptions ( which , in 2019 , included our games and cooking products ) totaled approximately 966,000 at the end of 2019 , a net increase of 319,000 subscriptions compared with the end of 2018. print domestic home delivery subscriptions totaled approximately 856,000 at the end of 2019 , a net decrease of 68,000 subscriptions compared with the end of 2018. the year-over-year decrease is a result of secular declines . advertising revenues advertising revenue is principally from advertisers ( such as technology , financial and luxury goods companies ) promoting products , services or brands on digital platforms in the form of display ads , audio and video , and in print , in the form of column-inch ads . advertising revenue is primarily derived from offerings sold directly to

million , compared with $ 260.5 million in 2019 , primarily driven by a decrease in creative service fees and direct-sold display advertising revenue . core digital advertising revenue decreased $ 5.8 million , primarily due to a 12 % decline in direct-sold display advertising revenue partially offset by a 26 % increase in podcast advertising revenues . direct-sold display impressions declined 15 % , while the average rate grew 3 % . other digital advertising declined $ 26.1 million as a result of lower creative services revenue resulting from the closure of our hellosociety and fake love digital marketing agencies and reduced spending by advertisers in connection with the effects of the covid-19 pandemic . this decline was partially offset by 7.8 % growth in open-market programmatic advertising revenue , as impressions increased by 40 % , while the average rate decreased 23 % . overall display advertising impressions sold increased 21 % as a result of an increase in traffic to our products , which were primarily filled by programmatic impressions . print advertising revenues , which represented 41.7 % of total advertising revenues in 2020 , declined $ 106.4 million or 39.4 % to $ 163.8 million in 2020 compared with $ 270.2 million in 2019. the decline was primarily in the entertainment , luxury and media categories , and was driven by reduced spending by advertisers in

partially offset by 9 % decline in direct-sold display advertising revenue . direct-sold display impressions increased by 1 % , while the average rate declined 4 % . other digital advertising revenue

it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and or interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement . factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status , collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and or interest payments . loans that experience insignificant payment delays or payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired . management determines the significance of payment delays or payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis . when determining the possibility of impairment , management considers the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower , including the length of the delay , the reasons for the delay , the borrower 's prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed . for collateral-dependent loans , the company uses the fair value of collateral method to measure impairment . all other loans are measured for impairment based on the present value of future cash flows . impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for all loans in the portfolio . a\n<|end_of_text|>\n\nAssistant: liquidity liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals , fund asset growth and business operations , and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates . liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in our business operations or unanticipated events . the ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors , creditors and regulators . our liquidity , represented by cash and amounts due from banks , federal funds sold and non-pledged marketable securities , is a result of our operating , investing and financing activities and related cash flows . in order to ensure funds are available when necessary , on at least a quarterly basis , we project the amount of funds that will be required , and we strive to maintain relationships with a diversified customer base . liquidity requirements can also be met through short-term borrowings or the disposition of short-term assets . the company has federal funds borrowing lines at correspondent banks totaling $ 10 million . in addition , loans and securities are pledged to the fhlb providing $ 61.4 million in available borrowing capacity as of december 31 , 2013. loans and securities pledged to the frb discount window provided $ 123.9 million in borrowing capacity . as of december 31 , 2013 , there were no outstanding borrowings from the frb . 37 index the company has established policies as well as analytical tools to manage liquidity . proper liquidity management ensures that sufficient funds are available to meet normal operating demands in addition to unexpected customer demand for funds , such as high levels of deposit withdrawals or increased loan demand , in a timely and cost effective manner . the most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of core deposits . ultimately , public confidence is gained through profitable operations , sound credit quality and a strong capital position .\n<|end_of_text|>\nYou are a seasoned stock market analyst. What is the summary of this financial text\n\nHuman: we have one reportable segment with businesses that include our core news product and other interest-specific products , and related content and services . we generate revenues principally from subscriptions and advertising . other revenues primarily consist of revenues from licensing , wirecutter affiliate referrals , the leasing of floors in the company headquarters , commercial printing , television and film , retail commerce and our live events business . our main operating costs are employee-related costs . in the accompanying analysis of financial information , we present certain information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america ( “ gaap ” ) . we are presenting in this report supplemental non-gaap financial performance measures that exclude depreciation , amortization , severance , non-operating retirement costs and certain identified special items , as applicable . these non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related gaap measures and should be read in conjunction with financial information presented on a gaap basis . for further information and reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures , see “ — results of operations — non-gaap financial measures . ” the new york times company – p. 29 the company changed the expense captions on its consolidated statement of operations effective for the quarter ended march 29 , 2020. these changes were made in order to reflect how the company manages its business and to communicate where the company is investing resources and how this aligns with the company 's strategy . the company reclassified expenses for the prior periods in order to present comparable financial results . there was no change to consolidated operating income , total operating costs , net income or cash flows as a result of this change in classification . see note 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more detail . we believe that a number of factors and industry trends have , and will continue to , present risks and challenges to our business . for a detailed discussion of certain factors that could affect our business , results of operations and financial condition , see “ item 1a — risk factors . ” 2020 financial highlights in 2020 , diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $ 0.60 , compared with $ 0.83 for 2019. diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding severance , non-operating retirement costs and special items discussed below ( or “ adjusted diluted earnings per share , ” a non-gaap measure ) were $ 0.97 for 2020 , compared with $ 0.92 for 2019. operating profit in 2020 was $ 176.3 million , compared with $ 175.6 million for 2019 , as the decrease in operating costs was largely offset by lower revenues . operating profit before depreciation , amortization , severance , multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs and special items discussed below ( or “ adjusted operating profit , ” a non-gaap measure ) was $ 250.6 million and $ 248.4 million for 2020 and 2019 , respectively . total revenues decreased 1.6 % to $ 1.78 billion in 2020 from $ 1.81 billion in 2019 , primarily driven by a decrease in advertising revenue and other revenue , partially offset by an increase in digital-only subscription revenues . subscription revenues increased 10.3 % to $ 1.20 billion in 2020. advertising revenues decreased 26.1 % to $ 392.4 million in 2020 largely due to lower print advertising revenue , driven by reduced spending by advertisers in connection with the effects of the covid-19 pandemic , which further accelerated secular trends . other revenues decreased 0.9 % to $ 195.9 million in 2020. operating costs decreased in 2020 to $ 1.61 billion from $ 1.63 billion in 2019 , due to a decrease in sales and marketing costs and cost of revenue costs , partially offset by an increase in product development costs and general and administrative costs . operating costs before depreciation , amortization , severance and multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs ( or “ adjusted operating costs , ” a non-gaap measure ) decreased in 2020 to $ 1.53 billion from $ 1.56 billion in 2019. impact of covid-19 pandemic the global covid-19 pandemic , and efforts to contain it , have continued to cause significant economic disruption , market volatility and uncertainty . these conditions have affected our business and could continue to do so for the foreseeable future . unlike many media companies , which are primarily dependent on advertising , we derive substantial revenue from subscriptions ( approximately 67 % of total revenues in 2020 ) . we experienced significant growth in the number of subscriptions to our digital news and other products in 2020 , which we believe was attributable in part to an increase in traffic given the news environment , and we do not expect the 2020 growth rate to be sustainable or indicative of results for future periods . while subscriptions grew , revenues from the single-copy and bulk sales of our print newspaper ( which collectively represented approximately 6 % of our total subscription revenues in 2020 ) were , and we expect will continue to be , adversely affected as a result of widespread business closures , continued increased levels of remote working and reductions in travel . the worldwide economic conditions caused by the pandemic also led to a significant decline in our advertising revenues in 2020 , and we expect that our advertising revenues will likely continue to be adversely affected if and while these conditions persist . however , our strong balance sheet has enabled us to continue to operate without the liquidity issues experienced by many other companies . as of december 27 , 2020 , we had cash , cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities of $ 882.0 story_separator_special_tag paid digital-only subscriptions totaled approximately 4,395,000 at the end of 2019 , a net increase of 1,035,000 subscriptions compared with the end of 2018. the growth in our digital subscriptions is attributable in part to an increase in traffic given the news environment , as well as a change made to the digital access model during 2019 , which requires users to register and log in to access most of our content . digital-only news product subscriptions totaled approximately 3,429,000 at the end of 2019 , a net increase of 716,000 subscriptions compared with the end of 2018. other product subscriptions ( which , in 2019 , included our games and cooking products ) totaled approximately 966,000 at the end of 2019 , a net increase of 319,000 subscriptions compared with the end of 2018. print domestic home delivery subscriptions totaled approximately 856,000 at the end of 2019 , a net decrease of 68,000 subscriptions compared with the end of 2018. the year-over-year decrease is a result of secular declines . advertising revenues advertising revenue is principally from advertisers ( such as technology , financial and luxury goods companies ) promoting products , services or brands on digital platforms in the form of display ads , audio and video , and in print , in the form of column-inch ads . advertising revenue is primarily derived from offerings sold directly to

2018 : replace_table_token_9_th 2020 compared with 2019 digital advertising revenues , which represented 58.3 % of total advertising revenues in 2020 , declined $ 31.9 million or 12.2 % to $ 228.6 million , compared with $ 260.5 million in 2019 , primarily driven by a decrease in creative service fees and direct-sold display advertising revenue . core digital advertising revenue decreased $ 5.8 million , primarily due to a 12 % decline in direct-sold display advertising revenue partially offset by a 26 % increase in podcast advertising revenues . direct-sold display impressions declined 15 % , while the average rate grew 3 % . other digital advertising declined $ 26.1 million as a result of lower creative services revenue resulting from the closure of our hellosociety and fake love digital marketing agencies and reduced spending by advertisers in connection with the effects of the covid-19 pandemic . this decline was partially offset by 7.8 % growth in open-market programmatic advertising revenue , as impressions increased by 40 % , while the average rate decreased 23 % . overall display advertising impressions sold increased 21 % as a result of an increase in traffic to our products , which were primarily filled by programmatic impressions . print advertising revenues , which represented 41.7 % of total advertising revenues in 2020 , declined $ 106.4 million or 39.4

and 2018 , respectively . 2020 compared with 2019 other revenues decreased 0.9 % in 2020 compared with 2019 , primarily as a result of fewer episodes in our television series ( “

herein are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in any future periods . this discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties , such as our plans , objectives , expectations and intentions . actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors . we use words such as “ anticipate , ” “ estimate , ” “ plan , ” “ project , ” “ continuing , ” “ ongoing , ” “ expect , ” “ believe , ” “ intend , ” “ may , ” “ will , ” “ should , ” “ could , ” and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements . significant accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our financial statements , which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states . the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets , liabilities , revenues and expenses , and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities . on an ongoing basis , we evaluate our estimates and judgments , including those related to revenue recognition , valuation of intangible assets and investments , share-based payments , income taxes and litigation . we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances , including assumptions as to future events . these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources . by their nature , estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty . actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position . we believe that the significant accounting policies as included in note 1 of the financial statements contained herein and management 's ongoing assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others . emerging growth company we qualify as an “ emerging growth company ” under the jobs act . as a result , we are permitted to , and intend to , rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements . for so long as we are an emerging growth company , we will not be required to : · have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 ( b ) of the sarbanes-oxley act ; · comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor 's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements ( i.e . , an auditor discussion and analysis ) ; · submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes , such as “ say-on-pay ” and “ say-on-frequency ; ” and · disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the ceo 's compensation to median employee compensation . in addition , section 107 of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section 7 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( b ) of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards . in other words , an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies . we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period . our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards . we will remain an “ emerging growth company ” for up to five years , or until the earliest of ( i ) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $ 1 billion , ( ii ) the date that we become a “ large accelerated filer ” as defined in rule 12b-2 under the securities exchange act of 1934 , which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates

involving a public offering . no commission was paid in connection with the sale of the promissory note . on april 29 , 2016 the company issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $ 4,700 to adam elmquist to evidence funds loaned by mr. elmquist in order to retire invoices as they came due . the note is for a six month term and accrues interest at a rate of 10 % per annum . as at september 30 , 2016 the note remained unpaid . the company made the offer and sale in reliance on the exemption from registration afforded by section 4 ( 2 ) story_separator_special_tag the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto included in this report beginning on page f-1 . the results shown herein are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in any future periods . this discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties , such as our plans , objectives , expectations and intentions . actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors . we use words such as “ anticipate , ” “ estimate , ” “ plan , ” “ project , ” “ continuing , ” “ ongoing , ” “ expect , ” “ believe , ” “ intend , ” “ may , ” “ will , ” “ should , ” “ could , ” and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements . significant accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our financial statements , which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states . the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets , liabilities , revenues and expenses , and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities . on an ongoing basis , we evaluate our estimates and judgments , including those related to revenue recognition , valuation of intangible assets and investments , share-based payments , income taxes and litigation . we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances , including assumptions as to future events . these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources . by their nature , estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty . actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position . we believe that the significant accounting policies as included in note 1 of the financial statements contained herein and management 's ongoing assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others . emerging growth company we qualify as an “ emerging growth company ” under the jobs act . as a result , we are permitted to , and intend to , rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements . for so long as we are an emerging growth company , we will not be required to : · have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 ( b ) of the sarbanes-oxley act ; · comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor 's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements ( i.e . , an auditor discussion and analysis ) ; · submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes , such as “ say-on-pay ” and “ say-on-frequency ; ” and · disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the ceo 's compensation to median employee compensation . in addition , section 107 of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section 7 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( b ) of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards . in other words , an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies . we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period . our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards . we will remain an “ emerging growth company ” for up to five years , or until the earliest of ( i ) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $ 1 billion , ( ii ) the date that we become a “ large accelerated filer ” as defined in rule 12b-2 under the securities exchange act of 1934 , which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $ 700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or ( iii ) the date on which we have issued more than $ 1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period\n\n\n**Original Answer:**\nliquidity and capital resources as of september 30 , 2016 we had $ 15,467 in cash and $ 15,488 in total assets , and $ 37,039 in total liabilities as compared to $ nil in cash and $ 262 in total assets , and $ 6,000 in total liabilities as of september 30 , 2015. the company is looking to raise up to $ 100,000 to fund its proposed operations for the next twelve months and has successfully raised a total of $ 24,725 under its s-1 registration statement to date . shortfalls in available funds , should they occur , are expected to be provided by management and other loan and or equity based financing arrangements . there can be no assurance that continued funding will be available on satisfactory terms . for the year ending september 30 , 2016 we used net cash of $ 17,458 in operating activities , compared to net cash provided of $ 4,800 in operating activities duringthe same period in fiscal 2015. during the year ended september 30 , 2016 , net cash of $ 32,925 was provided by financing activities compared to net cash of $ nil during the same period in fiscal 2015. further , net cash of $ 4,800 was used in investing activities during fiscal 2015 with no comparative expenditures in fiscal 2016. off-balance sheet arrangements we have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition , revenues or expenses , results of operations , liquidity , capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders .\n\n\n**Generated
